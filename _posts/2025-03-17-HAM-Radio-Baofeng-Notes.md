# Baofeng Menu Reference

![Desktop View](/assets/img/tutorials/radio/CHIRP-HAM-Radio-settings.png)

This is documentation for how to use a Baofeng Radio. I am using a UV-5R8W. Many far more technical and qualified people have done extensive tutorials, so you should check them out. But if you don't have much of a radio background to begin with or just need a quick brush up, this should be the guide for you. 

You will need 

- One Baofeng Radio 

- Connecting Cables

- CHIRP

## CHIRP
CHIRP is an open source python software for programming Baofengs and other radios with channels and other settings. The fields are as follows:

### Frequency
![Desktop View](/assets/img/tutorials/radio/CHIRP-HAM-Radio-settings.png)
This is the primary receive frequency that your radio is set to *listen* to.
In a repeater setup, this would be the frequency the *repeater* transmits on (which is why you hear others talking on this frequency).

### Name
Completely self set, this could be anything you want but generally it should just be the name of the station
### Tone Mode
### Tone

### DTCS
